# Windows Form Demo

This sample uses Winforms to demonstrate how to use BusinessValidation's validation capcbilitites. The focus of this demo is to demonstrate the abstractions `IBusinessValidator` and `BusinessValidator`.

In the application, nothing happens when the *Submit* buttons are clicked and all validation rules are observed.    
However, if you follow the instructions at the top of each panel which explain how to violate certain validation rules, when the *Submit* button is clicked, the Ui will display 1 or more validation messages (as applicable).
